# 🧠 Employee Turnover Prediction

This project predicts employee turnover using machine learning techniques. It aims to help HR departments proactively identify employees likely to leave the organization, enabling better workforce planning and retention strategies.

## 📊 Project Overview

* **Problem Statement**: Employee turnover can be costly and disruptive. Predicting which employees are likely to leave helps companies take proactive measures.
* **Goal**: Build a predictive model using historical HR data to classify whether an employee will leave the organization.
* **Approach**: Data preprocessing, visualization, feature engineering, and training classification models.

## 📁 Files

* `Employee Turnover Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the entire workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
* `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* Jupyter Notebook 📓
* NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn 📈
* Scikit-learn 🤖
* Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree

## 🔍 Features

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature encoding and selection
* Model training and testing
* Evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

## 🧪 Model Performance

| Model               | Accuracy |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | \~100%    |
| Decision Tree       | \~90%    |
| Random Forest       | \~90%    |

*Replace `XX%` with actual accuracy scores from your results.*
